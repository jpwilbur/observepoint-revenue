description: Use when a revenue or sales rep needs to size or price an ObservePoint contract for a prospect or customer — "scope this account", "how many pages do they need", "size a deal", "price out X", "build a usage proposal". Produces a usage + price breakdown plus a customer proposal and an evidence workbook.

# Scope Calculator

The single entry point reps use to scope an ObservePoint contract end to end. You **orchestrate two sub-skills** and assemble the deliverables — you do NOT do their work yourself.

## Flow

1. **Gather:** customer name, domain(s), use case (privacy / analytics / accessibility), and any regulations (CCPA, GDPR, …).
2. **Page count — invoke the `derive-page-count` skill.** It returns the `{rollup, per_domain}` object (defensible range + per-domain evidence). **Do NOT invent or estimate a page count yourself** — that skill owns it (spirals, cold starts, confidence).
3. **Usage + price — invoke the `size-and-price` skill**, feeding `page_count` = the SAME `rollup` low/anchor/high from step 2. **Do NOT improvise multipliers, cadence, or pricing yourself** — that skill owns them (regulation-based defaults, the cadence starting templates, the assumptions-to-verify list, and live pricing via the scripts). Let it run `fetch_pricing.py` + `compute_scope.py`.
4. **Assemble deliverables:**
   - **Evidence workbook:** `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/derive-page-count/scripts/build_evidence_appendix.py <perdomain.json> <customer>-evidence-appendix.xlsx`. Fed the step-2 `{rollup, per_domain}` (with `url_samples` per domain) PLUS a `usage` object so it renders the Annual Usage Breakdown sheet: `usage = {consent_states:{count,names}, pages_per_sweep: anchor.use_case_pages, annual_scans: anchor.predicted_scans, recommended_price: recommended_contract.price, recommended_scans: recommended_contract.scans, cadence_layers: anchor.cadence_by_layer}`.
   - **Proposal:** `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/scope-calculator/scripts/build_proposal.py <proposal.json> <customer>-proposal.docx`. This is a **comprehensive, rep-first** doc (ObservePoint-themed) that SHOWS the full derivation and ends with a strippable `[INTERNAL — REMOVE BEFORE SENDING]` section. Assemble `proposal.json` (full schema in the script's docstring) by mapping the two prior outputs:
     - `page_count` ← the step-2 `rollup` (`low/anchor/high/confidence/url_total/defensible/discounted/census_id/crawl_status`) + a `spiral_note` = the discount-transparency line.
     - `consent_states` = `{count: <scenarios multiplier>, names: [the consent-state names, e.g. Default/Opt-Out/GPC]}`.
     - `cadence_layers` ← step-3 `anchor.cadence_by_layer` verbatim.
     - `usage` = `{pages_per_sweep: anchor.use_case_pages, annual_scans: anchor.predicted_scans}`.
     - `pricing` = `{recommended_price: recommended_contract.price, recommended_scans: recommended_contract.scans, range_low_price: range.low.price_total, range_high_price: range.high.price_total, price_by_band: anchor.price.breakdown, pricing_source, modeled_scans: anchor.predicted_scans, modeled_price: anchor.price.total}` — the recommended pair is the **clean price ↔ exact scans** that reconcile in the calculator.
     - `internal` = `{assumptions: <the assumptions-to-verify list>, implied_frequency: anchor.implied_blended_frequency, thresholds_swept}`.
     - plus `customer`, `prepared_by`, `date`, `use_case`, `domains`, `properties_note`, `regulations`, and a one-line `monitoring_summary` (keep internal terms out of `monitoring_summary` — the generator rejects them).
   - **Always produce BOTH deliverables** — the proposal `.docx` AND the evidence `.xlsx`. Never hand over just one; the proposal references the workbook.
   - **Output location (uniform across the plugin) — one folder per account:** if the rep named a base folder use it, otherwise default to `~/Documents/ObservePoint Revenue/Scoping & Pricing/`. Create a **per-account subfolder** inside it named after the customer and write both files there — i.e. `~/Documents/ObservePoint Revenue/Scoping & Pricing/<Customer>/`. Expand `~` to the home dir and `mkdir -p` the per-account folder first; never write to a temp dir. Name the files `<Customer> - proposal.docx` and `<Customer> - evidence appendix.xlsx`. Report both **absolute paths** alongside the rep-facing breakdown (from `size-and-price`, including the assumptions-to-verify list).

## The single-source consistency rule

There is **one** Part-1 object, and it feeds BOTH sides. The page-count anchor that goes into pricing (`page_count.anchor`), the anchor in the evidence appendix (`rollup.spiral_adjusted_anchor`), and the page-universe anchor in the proposal MUST be the **same number**. Never re-derive or re-state the anchor — pass the one object through.

Use the **precise** anchor everywhere (e.g. `95721`, not a rounded `96000`) — feeding a rounded anchor into pricing or the appendix breaks the sum-to-anchor invariant and the cross-deliverable match. Round **only** in customer-facing display text, never in the numbers you pass between steps.

## Red Flags — STOP

- About to estimate a page count yourself → invoke `derive-page-count` instead.
- About to pick multipliers / cadence / a price yourself → invoke `size-and-price` instead (its defaults, flags, and live pricing must apply; an improvised cadence or buffer is the failure).
- The proposal, the appendix, and the price show **different** anchor numbers → STOP; you re-derived instead of passing one object through.
- About to hand over only one deliverable → reps need the chat breakdown AND both files.
